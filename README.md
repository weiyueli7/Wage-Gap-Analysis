# Wage Gap Analysis

This repository contains the data, source code, and report for the [analysis of the wage gap between genders from an occupational perspective](https://github.com/weiyueli7/Wage-Gap-Analysis/blob/main/report.pdf).

## Dependencies

This analysis uses Python for data cleaning and Stata for regression analysis. For convenience, the Stata course code is also written in the Python notebook using a package called [`pystata`](https://www.stata.com/python/pystata/). To install this package on your machine, please run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
pip install pystata
```
Note: Ensure that Stata is also installed on your machine, and when calling `pystata`, make sure to change the directory to where you installed Stata. Please refer to the notebook's pattern if you are unable to import the package.
